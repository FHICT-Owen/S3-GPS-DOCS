# Agile methods

## What is Agile?
Cited from Agile Alliance<sup>[1](#Sources)</sup>:
"Agile is the ability to create and respond to change. It is a way of dealing with, and ultimately succeeding in, an uncertain and turbulent environment.

The authors of the Agile Manifesto chose “Agile” as the label for this whole idea because that word represented the adaptiveness and response to change which was so important to their approach.

It’s really about thinking through how you can understand what’s going on in the environment that you’re in today, identify what uncertainty you’re facing, and figure out how you can adapt to that as you go along."

## What is Agile for Software Development?

According to Agile Alliances<sup>[2](#Sources)</sup> agile software development is an umbrella term for a set of frameworks and practices based on the values and principles expressed in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development and the 12 Principles behind it. Agile cover things like the different frameworks (SCRUM, Extreme programming & Feature-driven development) and various practices (pair programming, test-driven development, stand-ups, planning sessions & sprints). 

One thing that separates Agile from other approaches to software development is the focus on the people doing the work and how they work together. Solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams utilizing the appropriate practices for their context.

## Agile principles

According to Agile Alliance<sup>[3](#Sources)</sup> the 12 Agile principles are as follows:
1.  Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2.  Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
3.  Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4.  Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5.  Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6.  The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7.  Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8.  Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9.  CContinuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## What are Agile methodologies?
Agile methodologies are the conventions that a team chooses to follow in a way that follows Agile values and principles.<sup>[4](#Sources)</sup> Concepts like SCRUM and XP have a standardized set of values and principles, which is why they are frameworks rather than methodologies.

### Different Agile frameworks
- Scrum

> Scrum is the most pupular framework. A team that uses this methodology is led by a Scrum Master. Scrum works in cycles of development called sprints, these sprints have a length varying from 1 up to 4 weeks. Scrum teams hae daily meetings where the team discusses tasks and obstacles.

- Extreme programming (XP)

> XP and Scrum share the following concepts: release planning, daily meetings, retrospective and other elements of the agile process. The aspects that make XP different from scrum are: pair programming, code reviews and unit testing all code. 

- Feature-driven development
> Feature-driven development is an iterative and incremental software development process. It is a lightweight or Agile method for developing software. FDD blends a number of industry-recognized best practices into a cohesive whole. These practices are driven from a client-valued functionality perspective.


## Scrum explanation
Scrum is a framework that helps teams working together. Scrum learns teams to learn trough experience in the project. A team reflects on the positive and negative points and by doing this they continuously improve the process. Scrum focuses on small iterations and stories are determined in a sprint. 

### Daily scrum
Short stand-up meeting that takes place at the same time every day. In this meeting the team discusses tasks and obstacles.

### Sprint
A sprint is a cycle between 1 and 4 weeks in which work must be completed.

### Sprint review
In the sprint review you review the work that has been completed in the last sprint.

### Sprint retrospective
A sprint retrospective is held after the end of a sprint. In this meeting you reflect on the process and discuss the positive and negative. With this process you can improve the development.
