# Business process
## What is a business process?
A business process, business method or business function is a collection of related, structured activities or tasks by people or equipment in which a specific sequence produces a service or product (serves a particular business goal) for a particular customer or customers. Business processes occur at all organizational levels and may or may not be visible to the customers. A business process may often be visualized (modeled) as a flowchart of a sequence of activities with interleaving decision points or as a process matrix of a sequence of activities with relevance rules based on data in the process.<sup>[1](#Sources)</sup>

## How does a business proces relate to software applications?
A business process can be used to model the current flow of the processes taken care of without your application being involved. This knowledge or model can then be modified to facilitate the changes made by injecting your software application into the process. By doing this you'll have a clear understanding of what your application takes care of in the bigger business process it is consumed by.

## Customer serving business processes with and without our application
In the sections below there will be two different business processes shown. One of these is the BP without the automation from the application and one with that automation.

### Without application automation
This is the process that our app will be improving using automation.

### With application automation
This is the result of having applied the various automation steps using our software application.

## How does this affect our actors?

1. Customer
> The customer can order whenever they want and don't have to wait for a waiter to take in the order. If an order gets cancelled they will immediately know.

2. Waiter
> The waiter's job gets reduced to only having to serve dishes to the correct tables.

3. Kitchen staff
> The kitchen staff no longer has to wait for the communication with the waiter or have to use the waiter to communicate to the customer.
