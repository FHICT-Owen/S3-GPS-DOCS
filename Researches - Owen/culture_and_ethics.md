# Culture

To better understand the importance of culture to a software engineer the sections below will contain important information and questions that I'm going to answer in order to show that I know how important culture is.

## What is culture?
According to Wikipedia <sup>[1](#Sources)</sup> : 

> *"Culture is an umbrella term which encompasses the social behavior and norms found in human societies, as well as the knowledge, beliefs, arts, laws, customs, capabilities, and habits of the individuals in these groups. Humans acquire culture through the learning processes of enculturation and socialization, which is shown by the diversity of cultures across societies."*

## Culture clustering
A cultural cluster from what I understand is a geographical region that encompasses multiple countries that possibly share three or four cultural values like: history, religion, economic development, regional proximity, and other factors. A cultural cluster is used as a more efficient way to learn about cultural differences by analyzing a group of societies with a few similar values and comparing those to other clusters instead of analyzing societies one at a time.<sup>[2](#Sources)</sup>

Summarized by Virkus, S. in 2009 <sup>[3](#Sources)</sup> from (Northouse, 2007, p.309-313) the following cultural clusters can be identified in modern-day society:

- Anglo - competitive and result-oriented
- Confucian Asia - result-driven, encourage group working together over individual goals
- Eastern Europe - forceful, supportive of co-workers, treat women with equality
- Germanic Europe - value competition & aggressiveness and are more result-oriented
- Latin America - loyal & devoted to their families and similar groups
- Latin Europe - value individual autonomy
- Middle East - devoted & loyal to their own people, women afforded less status
- Nordic Europe - high priority on long-term success, women treated with greater equality
- Southern Asia - strong family & deep concern for their communities
- Sub-Sahara Africa - concerned & sensitive to others, demonstrate strong family loyalty

## My own culture
I was born in the Netherlands and still live there. My culture is the Dutch culture of the Netherlands, meaning that I celebrate Dutch holidays and have habits that are particular to Dutch culture like: hardworking, well-organized and not boasting about accomplishment or material possesion.

## Which cultural aspects would you keep in mind when facing cultural differences? 
When faced with cultural differences I would keep differences in things like social behaviour, norms, customs and possible habits very much in mind when interacting with the other party. I would embrace possible cultural differences and use cultural pluralism to compare and better understand the culture of the other party compared to my own.

## Can you give examples for things going not as expected when interacting with people from other cultures? What and why went differently? 
As part of how I spend my free time I help to moderate an online community of a brittish friend of mine, which consists of about 15000 individuals. Quite a few of these individuals come from different parts of the globe and therefore value things differently. As an example we, as staff, often help out our community members using a support system we have created where questions can be asked. The way our time is valued helping out individuals generally differs a lot between cultures where the brittish individuals would tend to thank us more often for our time than individuals from the U.S. (this is a personal observation).

## How would you act in the future when you know that you need to communicate or collaborate with a person from another culture?
I'd have to consider more often that my norms and values might not be the same as the other individual. As an example, I can take the abovementioned difference into account by comparing how their perspective might differ from my own.

## What did you do to improve the group communications with respect to cultural differences?
Specifically for our group project I helped to improve communications by speaking English as we have one non-native individual within our group. By doing what I mentioned in the previous section I also got to better understand how their outlook on project aspects is different from my own and other team members.

# Ethics

To better understand the significance of ethics related to software engineering I've written down a few questions below. In each sub-section I'll be answering the question for that section. After having completed this I will have proven that I have a sufficient amount of knowledge regarding the importance of ethics for a software engineer.

## What are ethics in software engineering?
First we need to understand what the ethics of software engineering are and how they can be approached. Below you'll find a short overview written by Gotterbarn, D. <sup>[4](#Sources)</sup> that explains these ethics: 

> *"Software engineering ethics can be approached from three directions. First, it can
describe the activity of software engineers making practical choices that affect other
people in significant ways. Second, it can be used to describe a collection of principles,
guidelines, or ethical imperatives that guide or legislative action, and third, it can be used
to name a discipline that studies the relationship between the other two senses of ethics.
Software engineering ethics is clearly both an activity and a body of principles. The
discipline of software engineering ethics that studies this activity and formalizes these
principles, however, is in its infancy."*

## Why are ethics important to a software engineer?
Nowadays software has more and more influence on our daily lives, which implies that it is more and more important to consider how software affects us both positively and negatively. We use Ethics in software engineering to chart the effects that software has and consciously consider the way software is developed. 

Ethics are very important to a software engineer, because software engineers need to be aware that they are responsible for the effects that their software has on individuals, as they create the code that changes the software-controlled parts we depend upon. 

## What do you have to do as a software engineer to address ethical aspects in your work?
As a software engineer you should address the ethical aspects of your work by considering the code of ethics for software engineers written by the Association for Computer Machinery, summarized by Cast of Software <sup>[5](#Sources)</sup>:

> 1. PUBLIC - Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.
> 2. CLIENT AND EMPLOYER - Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their client and employer consistent with the public interest.
> 3. PRODUCT - Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.
> 4. JUDGMENT - Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment.
> 5. MANAGEMENT - Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance.
> 6. PROFESSION - Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest.
> 7. COLLEAGUES - Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.
> 8. SELF - Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession.

## How do you know that your ethical considerations match with those of other software engineers?
By discussing with other software engineers how you each view the ethics of your work you can confirm if your own ethical considerations match those of other software engineer. Also, the previously mentioned ACM guidelines on software engineering ethics are a good starting point for discussing ethical considerations, because you can compare how your interpretation of the guidelines might differ compared to other software engineers.

## Which ethical aspects play a role in your project?
Looking back at our project from the current point in time (last 2 weeks before finishing) the ethical aspects that play a part in our project
according to the summarized ACM guidelines are all the points mentioned. The most important ones in my opinion regarding the project are the PUBLIC, CLIENT AND EMPLOYER, PRODUCT and COLLEAGUES aspects. 

## Do you foresee ethical conflicts caused by your software? What kind of?
The only ethical conflict that I could see being caused by our software is regarding private client information about allergies. If information saved by various restaurants regarding allergies of individuals gets shared between companies or sold to other companies this could cause ethical conflicts that affect the end-user negatively in regards to privacy.

## Can you do something to avoid or minimize these conflicts?
To minimize the affects of the abovementioned conflict it could be a good idea to clearly state that the end-user's information regarding allergies will only be saved with explicit permission from the individual. Adding a disclaimer with regards to sharing information about allergies with other companies if the restaurant in question decides they would want that also minimizes the possible conflict here.
